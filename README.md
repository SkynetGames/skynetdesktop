# skynetdesktop
No longer developed and pretty broken, this is only kept around for historic reasons

FAQs;
- Why python?
    - We wanted to support all major desktop OSes, so Python seemed like a choice that would allow us to maintain a single code base and easily port it to Linux, MacOS, or Windows.
- Why abandon this?
    - The language of choice for almost everyone who works on Skynet is C#, when we discovered the [Avalonia](http://avaloniaui.net) framework we realized we could develop a cross platform app with the single code base, plus we could do it in a language we like more.
- Why not just use Electron?
     - Does the world really need *another* electron app sucking 60% of your RAM?
- Can I and use this?
     - Well you can run this, and it'll probably work mostly but this isn't actually a working client.
- Will there be any more development?
     - As of today (12/19/2018) there will be no more active development from the Skynet team on the Python client, but that does't mean that there is no more development, go check out the [master](https://github.com/SkynetGames/skynetdesktop/tree/master) branch for the most recent stable version or if you like to live on the edge check out the [devlopment](https://github.com/SkynetGames/skynetdesktop/tree/development). But, as always, the code will still be here and be open source so if you *really* want a Python Skynet client then we will happily review and merge any changes you make. So be the change you want to see in the world
- Did anyone actually ask these question?
     - No, but they are answered anyways.
